Project Preview: High-Risk Mental Illness Detection Using NLP 
and a virtual companion which i named as  "ClarityX1".

Project Overview:
This project focuses on building an intelligent system that can detect high-risk mental illness episodes by analyzing speech patterns and keywords associated with psychosis, delusions, and other severe mental health issues. Leveraging NLP algorithms and machine learning models, the system classifies mental health risk levels into low, medium, and high-risk categories based on what individuals are saying during conversations.
